A cross platform **IPTv player** developed for Android/IOS.

You can watch and add channels to your favorite list from all around the globe. You can access channels according to your preference of choice or based upon your country. 

This app contains roughly [10,000 channels](https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/channels.json) that are freely available to watch. 

## **Overview**

The app uses the [IPTV API](https://iptv-org.github.io) as a data sources and uses the standard dart libraries for making network requests.

In terms of UI, the goal was replicating the Android design as closely as possible to understand the possibilities that Flutter offers for crafting UIs.
